# Location Based Services applications

## Synopsis

This repository gathers several sub projects developped on behalf of the GENIVI Allliance, based on a set of Location Based Services (LBS) APIs.
These projects are applications for demonstrating the main features covered by the APIs

## Motivation

The GENIVI Alliance standardizes the non differentiating part of the In Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) middleware by delivering requirements, interfaces and code. The LBS deliveries are requirements and interfaces. 
An open source API for navigation allows to easily plug HMI or application coming from different vendors on top of the navigation middleware, by limiting the porting workload and providing reused tools for unitary and integration testing.

## Sub projects

See the README for each of the projects for build, run and test the code

The navigation and the Fuel Stop Advisor applications are located here

Some test scripts are available here
