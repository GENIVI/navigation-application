This test bench requires Python version >= 3.4 and uses pygame.

How to get pygame
It seems you need to build it, so follow this recipe:
(thanks to Sir on http://heritagerobotics.wordpress.com/category/xubuntu-stuff/)
cd  
sudo apt-get install mercurial
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame
cd pygame
sudo apt-get install python3-dev  python3-numpy  libsdl-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev  libsdl-mixer1.2-dev  libsdl-ttf2.0-dev  libsmpeg-dev  libportmidi-dev  libavformat-dev  libswscale-dev libjpeg-dev libfreetype6-dev
python3 setup.py build
sudo python3 setup.py install

You need some other packages
sudo apt-get install python3-gobject

To test:

Launch the application without the logreplayer:
./run -r

Launch the test dashboard (keyboard interface)
(the test dashboard calls the logreplayer and uses test log files)
python3 simulation-dashboard.py

Steps:
'i' launches initialization.log
's' launches start.log
'h' launches high-tank-level.log
'l' launches low-tank-level.log
'x' exits the dashboard (or close the window)

Test scenario:

Assume no ./ambd/ambd process is still running (kill -9 if necessary)
Assume application launched (./run -r) and test panel launched (python simulation-dashboard.py) successfully.
The main HMI of FSA is displayed, and the test panel too, with right values displayed (Lat 46.202 Lon 6.147)

Click on trip computer button
(nothing is activated)
Into the test panel, enter 'i' 
Into the test panel, enter 'h'
Fuel level is 30 l, trip values are displayed after 400 m
Only tank distance is available (no guidance active)

Click on BACK button
Go to enter a destination
Go to enter a destination per address
Click on city button
Enter zuri..
Select Zürich into the list
Click on street button
Enter lamp..
Select In Lampitzäcken into the list
Click on OK button
Click on set as destination
(the GO TO button is activated)
Click on GO TO button
Route is calculated, DISTANCE = 286 km, TIME = 2:39:46
Click on ON button (to activate the guidance)
The map is displayed
To activate the simulation:
Click on Menu button
Click on settings button
(simulation panel)
Click on ON button to start the simulation
Simulation is started
Click on BACK button

Click on trip computer button
Enhanced tank distance is lower than tank distance but > 286 km (route total distance)
Into the test panel, enter 'l' 
Fuel level is 15 l, Enhanced tank distance is lower than  286 km !
Click on BACK button
Click on map
A F is diplayed, click on it
Into the poi menu, click on SEARCH
Select a full station
The info about the station are displayed
Click on REROUTE

Known issues:

ambd process sometimes not killed, so check it
./kill_all to kill all the process but still issue with ambd ?
so you need to do kill -9 of the amb process
