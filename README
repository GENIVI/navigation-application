Status: tested from scratch on Ubuntu 14.04.1

Project:
Navigation application based on Navit and compliant with the Navigation APIs standardized by the GENIVI Alliance
This project is one of the navigation projects that implements the GENIVI navigation APIs.

More:
The GENIVI APIs are implemented into Navit plugins, running on DBus. The HMI is made in Qml (Qt5.2 and QtQuick 2.1)
See also other navigation projects like proof of concepts implemented for poi-service, traffic-info and positioning 

What is in:
This repository contains the application (with the HMI) of the navigation project
It's possible to build and run the whole stuff (including the navit and the plugins) directly from this repository
FYI: the scripts for building Navit and the GENIVI plugins are located into http://git.projects.genivi.org/lbs/navigation-service.git
	 this repository is cloned during the build
