See also other navigation projects like proof of concepts implemented for poi-service, traffic-info and positioning 

What is in:
This repository contains the application (with the HMI) of the navigation project
It's possible to build and run the whole stuff (including the navit and the plugins) directly from this repository
FYI: the scripts for building Navit and the GENIVI plugins are located into http://git.projects.genivi.org/lbs/navigation-service.git
